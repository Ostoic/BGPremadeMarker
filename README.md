# PremadeMarker
A 3.3.5 World of Warcraft Addon For Automatically Managing Party Marks in Premade BG Groups

This is an addon for those premade battleground group leaders who forget (like myself) to mark premade members, and also convert to raid so that the marks persist for the incoming battleground. PremadeMarker will do this whenever the addon user joins a battleground. Previously, the addon would only automatically mark members as soon as it was able to, which could be an annoyance in PVE situations.

# Installation
From the releases page https://github.com/Ostoic/PremadeMarker/releases, download PremadeMarker-1.1.0.zip, then unzip the contents into your desired folder. Move the folder that was inisde the .zip named "PremadeMarker" into your %WowRoot%/Interface/Addons folder, just like any other addon.


# Commands
* Typing "/mark" in chat will automatically mark as many party members as possible.

* Typing "/unmark" in chat will unmark all party members.

* Typing "/remark" is equivalent to running /unmark then /mark.
