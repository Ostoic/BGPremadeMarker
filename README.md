# PremadeMarker
A 3.3.5 World of Warcraft Addon For Automatically Managing Party Marks in Premade BG Groups

This is an addon for those premade battleground group leaders who forget (like myself) to mark premade members, and also convert to raid so that the marks persist in the incoming battleground. PremadeMarker will do this whenever the addon user joins a battleground. Previously, the addon would only automatically mark members as soon as it was able to, which could be an annoyance in PVE situations.

# Commands
Typing "/mark" in chat will automatically mark as many party members as possible.

Typing "/unmark" in chat will unmark all party members.

Typing "/remark" is equivalent to running /unmark then /mark.
